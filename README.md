1.Colour recognition using opencv
• Define the range of each color and
create the corresponding mask.
• image frame and mask is performed to
specificaly detect that particular color
and discard others.
• Create contour for the individual colors
to display the detected colored region
distinguishly.

• Finally we can detect the colors in real-
time.

2.Document Scanner
Steps:

• Step 1: Detect edges.
• Step 2: Use the edges in the image to
find the contour (outline) representing
the piece of paper being scanned.
• Step 3: Apply a perspective transform to
obtain the top-down view of the
document.
